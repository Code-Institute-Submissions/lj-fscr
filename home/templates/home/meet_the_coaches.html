                <p class="p-font pb-2">
                    Strength and Conditioning coach and Applied Sport Scientist, with 5-years of experience working in the English Premier League. He is currently the First Team Rehabilitation Coach at Crystal Palace F.C.
                </p>
                <p class="p-font pb-2">
                    As an average footballer growing up, Michael began to seek ways to improve his own athletic performance which led him towards pursuing a career in Sports Science. He completed his undergraduate degree in Sports and Exercise Science at Leeds Beckett University, graduating in 2014 with a first-class honour’s degree.
                </p>
                <p class="p-font pb-2">
                    Whilst seeking coaching opportunities within elite-level sport, Michael gained his personal training qualifications and began working as a personal trainer. Soon after, he was able to secure a part-time voluntary role within the Crystal Palace F.C. academy delivering S&C support within the foundation and development age groups. After a season in the academy, he was offered an internship role with the first team at Crystal Palace F.C for the 2015-16 season.
                </p>
                <p class="p-font pb-2">
                    After one season as an intern, Michael became the First Team Sports Scientist during the 2016-17 season. This role required him to manage the use of technology within the club, and based on the data collected, provide insights to coaching, medical, and sport science staff to improve performance and reduce injury incidence.
                </p>
                <p class="p-font pb-2">
                    Alongside this position, Michael enrolled onto the Strength and Conditioning distance learning MSc programme at St Mary’s University in 2017. Shortly after, Michael became First Team Assistant Strength and Conditioning coach at Crystal Palace F.C., which required him to assist in the planning and delivery of the gym-based strength and power programme for first-team players. However, after 3-months in this role, Michael became the First Team Rehabilitation Coach at Crystal Palace F.C. following a medical department restructure. This role, which he currently possesses, requires him to plan and deliver all pitch and gym-based training for players in rehabilitation, to ensure a smooth transition to training and match-play.
                </p>
                <p class="p-font pb-2">
                    In July 2020, Michael completed his MSc in Strength and Conditioning from St Mary’s University achieving a distinction. He is currently looking to publish his thesis titled: “The Influence of Physical Load and Contextual Variables on Objective and Subjective Measures of Post-match Fatigue” in the Journal of Sports Sciences.

                    Frazer is an applied sport scientist and strength and conditioning coach with experience in the physical preparation of elite athletes for numerous sporting organisations. He completed his undergraduate degree in Sport and Exercise Science at Liverpool John Moore’s University and is currently completing his MSc in Strength and Conditioning at St Mary’s University Twickenham.

                <p class="p-font pb-2">
                    His previous experience includes the preparation of an international Gibraltarian sprinter in the lead up to the 100m and 200m indoor European championships. Frazer then moved into professional football with roles at Millwall F.C. and then Liverpool F.C. working within the academy sports science department. This led to a position within the Football Association of Wales working with the U19 and U21 squads as Lead Sports Scientist.

                    While working for the FAW an opportunity presented itself to work for Helvetia Performance, a start-up performance centre in Geneva, Switzerland. This position involved working with some unique Olympic athletes across a wide-range of sports such as ice hockey and snowboarding. Shortly after joining, an opportunity arose within the company to relocate to Las Vegas, America, where he became performance director of an e-sport gaming team. This involved implementing ideas from professional sports into the gaming world. This relocation also provided an opportunity to establish relationships with specialist practitioners at Las Vegas Golden Knights and Cirque Du Soeil.

                <p class="p-font pb-2">
                    Frazer left Helvetia Performance in 2019 to join Crystal Palace F.C. where he secured a position as First Team Strength and Conditioning coach. Alongside Crystal Palace F.C., he continues to work for the FAW.
