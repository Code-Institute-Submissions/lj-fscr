            <p class="font-14">Jayden is a 23-year old striker playing semi-professional football. It is the last minute of the match, the score is 1-1 and Jayden is sprinting through on goal. Suddenly, he feels a sharp pain in the back of his thigh, he pulls up, and the defender recovers the ball safely. The chance is gone, and Jayden hobbles off the pitch. Hamstring injury. His manager pulls him to one side after the match and says “that will be you done for a couple of weeks then, I’ll have to give the new lad a try”. Jayden is despondent and wants to return as soon as possible to make sure he doesn’t lose his place in the team. One week later his hamstring feels better and he thinks “maybe it was just cramp, I’ll give training a go tonight”. He turns up to training, and assures the manager that he is good to go. 15-minutes later, Jayden attempts to sprint, BANG, he is sent sprawling to the floor grasping his hamstring again. Except this time, he needs two of his teammates to help him off the pitch.</p>
