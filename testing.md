#### Testing user stories

#### Manual function testing

To ensure my site was working correctly I carried out some manual function testing;



#### Validator checks

The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project. The code was entered through direct input. JS hint was used to check for any errors with my Javascript files. 
JS was also tested by opening the developer console window on Chrome and checking for any errors as I clicked through the site.
I used the PEP8 online checking tool to inspect my Python code against the style conventions in PEP 8.

- [**HTML Validator**](https://validator.w3.org/)


- [**CSS Validator**](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)


- [**JS hint**](https://jshint.com/)

#### Audits

[Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) was used to run a series of audits to improve the quality of web pages. Overall performance and errors are highlighted below.

#### Responsive Design

- Site created as a mobile-first design.

- Viewport tag included in the head of HTML files to tell the browser how to respond to different resolutions, particularly mobile ones.

- Media queries used in the CSS file to target larger devices.
