# &rarr; **User Experience (UX)**

### **<u>Purpose</u>**

**FSCR** (Football Strength Conditioning Rehab) focuses on providing structured and detailed fitness programmes for football-related injuries. This is a full-stack site that has been created around business logic and used to control a centrally-owned dataset.

This application was built for a client who is currently looking to utilise their expertise in football rehabilitation by creating easy-to-follow fitness programmes. Rehabilitation after an injury can often be overlooked and my client is extremely passionate about ensuring athletes get the full recovery they need to get back to their sport and prevent further injury.

By completing this project I will have shown greater experience in HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and demonstrated my understanding of Python+Django. I will have also shown my competency in using a relational database, setting up an authentication mechanism, and providing payment transactions using stripe payments. 


### **<u>Design</u>**

**Research**

- I spent some time researching other fitness and retail sites to gain inspiration and created a mood board with a collection of elements that caught my eye.

**Logo Design**

When it comes to creating a business, the logo is the central visual element in helping customers find, recognise and remember a brand. Taking this into consideration, I decided to spend some time creating a logo for FSCR which would represent the brand well.

I set up a meeting with my client and presented them with a moodboard of different designs and gathered their feedback.

### **<u>Wireframes</u>**

As part of the design process, I created wireframes using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/?gclid=Cj0KCQjw28T8BRDbARIsAEOMBczzBYzsoMjbTtqNXQaE1EgOWA2u_Qux7sLl2IUHe-p0lDC-294BfVgaAr-oEALw_wcB). Creating these mock-ups helped me plan the basic structure and arrangement of the features for my site.
