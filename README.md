# &rarr; **User Experience (UX)**

### **<ins>Purpose</ins>**

**FSCR** (Football Strength Conditioning Rehab) focuses on providing structured and detailed fitness programmes for football-related injuries. This is a full-stack site that has been created around business logic and used to control a centrally-owned dataset.

This application was built for a client who is currently looking to utilise their expertise in football rehabilitation by creating easy-to-follow fitness programmes. Rehabilitation after an injury can often be overlooked and my client is extremely passionate about ensuring athletes get the full recovery they need to get back to their sport and prevent further injury.

By completing this project I will have shown greater experience in HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and demonstrated my understanding of Python+Django. I will have also shown my competency in using a relational database, setting up an authentication mechanism, and providing payment transactions using stripe payments. 

### **<ins>Design</ins>**

**Structure**

- A simple design structure with a fixed navbar side navigation menu accessible from every page of the site. A brand logo is displayed in the top left of the screen to allow easy navigation back to the homepage.

- As well as including a page title on my base.html, I have also added the meta description tag to help optimize my click-through rate from search engine result pages.

**Colour scheme**

- After undergoing research into other fitness related sites and reviewing the [psychology behind colours](https://www.mypersonaltrainerwebsite.com/blog/how-to-use-color-psychology-to-create-the-perfect-fitness-website), I created my final palette using [Coolors](https://coolors.co).

> **Red:** Passion for the sport and a never-say-die attitude.

> **Blue:** Dependability, trust, and honesty

> **Grey:** paragraph Calmness and neutrality, focus, and precision.

> **Purple:** Overcoming physical challenges and limitations and setting farther more difficult goals.

<br>

- A lighter shade of the grey (#bdc1c750) featured in the palette above has been used as the main background colour throughout the site with a lighter shade (#f8f8f8) used for banners.
- #fafafa has been used for forms

**Typography**

- The font used throughout the site is 'Lato' which belongs to the sans-serif typeface family. The font is neutral and easily readable, making it a good choice for web design.

- Sans Serif as the fallback font if for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly.

- Icons used throughout the site have been taken from [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) and [FlatIcon](https://www.flaticon.com/).

**Research**

- I spent some time researching other fitness and retail sites to gain inspiration and created a mood board with a collection of elements that caught my eye.

**Logo Design**

When it comes to creating a business, the logo is the central visual element in helping customers find, recognise, and remember a brand. Taking this into consideration, I decided to spend some time creating a logo for FSCR which would represent the brand well.

I set up a meeting with my client and presented them with a mood board of different designs and gathered their feedback.

My final design with client approval is displayed below;

**Favicon**

I created a personalised favicon for the site to add branding, and to make it easier for visitors to locate the page when they have multiple tabs open. I decided to keep the design simple and conventional by using only the first initial of the logo.

### **<ins>Database</ins>**

For this project I employed a [Relational Database](https://aws.amazon.com/relational-database/#:~:text=A%20relational%20database%20is%20a,be%20represented%20in%20the%20database.), to store my collection of data. I used [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) in development, as this is created by default, and [Heroku Postgres](https://www.heroku.com/postgres) in production. Relational databases were a suitable choice for this project as it allows multiple tables to be created, with data easily connected through the use of foreign keys. All Models included are related to at least one other Model, and implement common database relationships: many-to-one, many-to-many and one-to-one.

> **Note:** .sqlite3, my developmemt database file, was added to .gitignore before my initial commit to stop it being pushed to GitHub.

### **<ins>Data Schema</ins>**

To help visualize my database, I created a diagram using [dbdiagram](https://dbdiagram.io/) which illustrates the relationships between my models.

The `Product` model within the product's app, is used to store information about individual products.
The `Category` model within the product's app, is used to group products into specific categories.

The `Programme` model within the programme's app, is used to store information about individual programmes.
The `Category` model within the programme's app, is used to group programmes into specific categories.

The `UserProfile` model within the profiles app is used to store user's profile information and is connected to various models to fill other requirements;
- Checkout `Order` model - to store user's checkout information, as well as order history.
- Blog `Post` and `Comment` model - to store the name of the user who created the blog and those who have left a comment.
- Forum `Thread` and `Reply` model - to store the name of the user who created the thread and those who have replied.

The `Post` model within the blog app, is used to store posts added by the admin user.
The `Comment` model within the blog app, is used to store comments added by the user who is logged in.

The `Thread` model within the forum app, is used to store threads added by the user.
The `Reply` model within the forum app, is used to store replies made by the user logged in.

The `Order` model within the checkout app, is used to store orders.
The `OrderLineItem` model within the checkout app, is used to store information about individual products on the order.
The `ProgOrderLineItem` model within the checkout app, is used to store information about individual programmes on the order.

### **<ins>User Stories</ins>**

The basic page structure of my site is presented below;

### **<ins>Wireframes</ins>**

As part of the design process, I created wireframes using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/). Creating these mock-ups helped me plan the basic structure and arrangement of the features for my site.

#### Wireframes vs. Deployed site

The deployed site has some differences vs. the wireframes I initially created, the main discrepancies are highlighted below;

|   | Change                                        | Reason                                                                                                             |
|---|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | Menu icon positioning                         | The menu is displayed on the left instead of the right, this was only changed for my own personal visual reasons   |
| 2 | Testimonial carousel repositioned on homepage | It wasn't visually pleasing to have two carousels on top of one another                                            |
| 3 | Latest blogs added to homepage                 | Client wanted this to be a focus on the homepage                                                                   |
| 4 | Contact form added to homepage                | This wasn't included on my wireframes but I added this to the bottom of my homepage which is a common positioning  |
| 5 | Removed red buttons                           | I decided not to use red buttons to avoid the possibility of user confusion                                        |
| 6 | 'Add to bag' and 'View more details' on programmes page | I decided not to have these buttons and to keep it in line with the structure of the product page by viewing on image click |
| 7 | Sample fitness plan removed from programme detail | Client didn't want to provide an example template so this was removed |
| 8 | View bag and checkout options available on 'add to bag' success toast | I decided to add both options so the user has the option to view their bag or just go straight to the checkout |

## &rarr; **Deployment**

#### Deploy to Heroku

The project was deployed to Heroku with all static and media files stored on Amazon S3. I also set up automatic deployment to ensure my Heroku app was always up to date with my GitPod repository.

> **Note:** As all static and media files were stored in an AWS bucket these are not available through the GitHub repository. Please contact the site owner if you wish to use any of the images included.

This project also requires a `Gmail Account` with an app secret password, to allow emails to be sent to users. Sign up for a Gmail account [here](https://accounts.google.com/signup/v2/webcreateaccount?hl=en&flowName=GlifWebSignIn&flowEntry=SignUp)

If you would like to add the Django allauth `Social Account Login` feature to your site they're many useful online guides to help you get set up. The list of social providers can be found [here](https://django-allauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/providers.html)

If you would like to add the `Stripe Payments` feature to your site, the Stripe documentation can be found [here](https://stripe.com/docs)

> **Note:** In the following documentation, all environment variables are included, assuming that you are implementing all the sites features. If you are not using certain aspects, these variables can be excluded.

<details>
<summary>Deploying to Heroku</summary>
<p>

> **Note:** Before following the below steps ensure you have already created your new repo in Github.

1. Log in (or Register) to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and from your dashboard click 'new' > 'create new app'.

   ![New app btn](readme/media/new-app.png)

2. Enter your 'App name' and choose the appropriate region, then click 'Create app'.
   > **Note:** 
 The app name must be unique, all lowercase, and '-' to be used instead of spaces.
The region chosen should be the one closest to you.

   ![Create new app](readme/media/create-new-app.png)

3. Then on the 'Resources' tab, search and add on the Heroku Postgres database.

4. To use Postgres, install dj_database_url, and psycopg2 in the project terminal using the following commands;

    `$ pip3 install dj_database_url`

    `$ pip3 install psycopg2`

5. Freeze the requirements to ensure Heroku installs all the apps requirements when deployed using the following command;

    `$ pip3 freeze > requirements.txt`

6. To migrate to the postgres, go to settings.py and add the following import;

    `import dj_database_url`

   Then down in the databases setting comment out the default configuration and replace the default database with a call to dj_database_url.parse and give it the database URL from Heroku.

   ![Config Vars](readme/media/database_url.png)

    > **Note:** You can either get the database URL from your config variables in your app settings tab or from the command line by typing Heroku config.

7. Apply all migrations using the following command;

    `$ python3 manage.py migrate`

    After migrations have been applied amend your database configurations to;

    ![Config Vars](readme/media/database_url2.png)

     > **Note:** This will ensure that your Postgres database is used in deployment and your sqlite3 in development.
    
    Your database should now be all set up.

8. Create a superuser to log in with using the following command;

    `$ python3 manage.py createsuperuser`


9. Go to the Settings tab on Heroku, scroll to the 'Config Vars' section, and click 'Reveal Config Vars'. 

   ![Config Vars](readme/media/config-vars.png)

   Enter the variables (key and value) contained in your environment settings or stored in an env.py. The keys are listed below and values are inputted by the user.

| Key               | Value               |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID | To be added by user |
| AWS_SECRET_KEY_ID | To be added by user |
| USE_AWS           |        TRUE         |
| DATABASE_URL      | To be added by user |
| EMAIL_HOST_PASS   | To be added by user |
| EMAIL_HOST_USER   | To be added by user |
| SECRET_KEY        | To be added by user |
| STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY | To be added by user |
| STRIPE_SECRET_KEY | To be added by user |
| STRIPE_WH_SECRET  | To be added by user |

10. Install gunicorn using the following command;

    `$ pip3 install gunicorn`

    Then freeze into your requirements file.

11. Create a Procfile and add the following line;

    `web: gunicorn lj_fscr.wsgi:application`

    This tells Heroku to create a web dyno which will run gunicorn and serve the Django app.

    > **Note:** The **P**rocfile must be assigned a capital P.

12. Last, you need to temporarily disable collectstatic to ensure that Heroku won't try to collect static files when we deploy. This is done by adding the below variable;

    | DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC  | 1 |

13. Add the hostname of your Heroku app to allowed hosts in settings.py

14. Now you can commit all the changes and push to GitHub;

    `$ git add .`
    `$ git commit -m <'your commit message'>`
    `$ git push`

    If you created your app on the website you will need to initialize your Heroku git remote using the following command;

    `$ heroku git:remote -a lj-fscr`

    Then use the following command to push to Heroku;

    `$ git push heroku master`

<summary>Deploying AWS Static and Media files</summary>
<p>

The project used Amazon Web Services s3, which is a cloud-based storage service, to store static and media files.

1. Create an account by navigating to [aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com/) and clicking create an AWS account. Fill in your email and password, and a username for your account, and select continue.

2. Now on the account type page, select personal and fill out the required information, click create an account and continue.

3. Next you will be asked to enter a credit card number which will be used for billing if we go above the free usage limits. Beyond this, you'll be asked a couple more verification questions then once all required information is confirmed your account will be created.

   > **Note**: For this project, I didn't go anywhere near the usage limits but keep in mind that AWS is not free if you go above the free usage limits.

4. Now you can navigate back to [aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com/) and sign-in to your account.

5. Navigate to AWS management console under my account and using the 'find services' search bar, find s3.

6. Now open s3 and create a new bucket to store all your files.

- Enter a name for your bucket
    > **Note**: I'd recommend naming your bucket to match your Heroku app name.

- Select a region
    > **Note**: Select the region closest to you like you did when creating your Heroku app.

- Uncheck block all public access and acknowledge that the bucket will be public.
    > **Note**: Allows public access to our static files.

- Click create bucket and your bucket should be created.

7. Now click into your new bucket and set some settings;

- On the properties tab and turn on static website hosting.

    > **Note**: For the index and error document, just fill in some default values.

- On the permissions tab 

  - Paste in a **CORS Configuration** to set up the required access between your Heroku app and this s3 bucket. Copy the code below supplied by CodeInstitute;

        [
        {
            "AllowedHeaders": [
                "Authorization"
            ],
            "AllowedMethods": [
                "GET"
            ],
            "AllowedOrigins": [
                "*"
            ],
            "ExposeHeaders": []
        }
        ]

  - In the **Bucket Policy** tab, select policy generator
    - Policy type is 's3 bucket policy'
    - Allow all principles using a *
    - Actions is 'GetObject'
    - Add in your ARN (found on previous page)
    - Click 'Add statement' then 'Generate policy'
    - Copy the policy code and paste it into the bucket policy editor

       > **Note:** To allow access to all resources in this bucket add a slash star onto the end of the resource key.
    
    - Click save

  - In the **Access Control List** tab, under the Public Access section, set the list objects permission to everyone.

8. Create a user to access the bucket created.

- Search for a new service 'IAM'
- Now open IAM, navigate to 'groups' and click 'Create new group'

  > **Note:** You can call your group whatever you want but try to give it a name that makes sense to you for what it is.

- Create a policy by navigating to 'policies' and click 'Create policy'
- Go JSON tab and click 'import managed policy'
  - Search for s3 and then import the s3 full access policy.
    - Replace resource value '*' with your bucket ARN from the bucket policy page;

    "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::lj-fscr",
        "arn:aws:s3:::lj-fscr/*"
    ]

  - Click 'Review policy', give it a name and a description and click 'Create policy'

9. Attach the policy to the group you created.
- Navigate to 'groups', select the group you created and on permissions tab select 'Attach policy'.
- Search for the policy you created, select it and click 'Attach policy'.

- Now to create the user, navagate to 'users' and click 'Add user'
  - Add username, select programmatic access and click 'Next'
  - Add user to a group by selecting the group you created and click 'Next' then click through to the end and click 'Create user'
  - Now download the CSV file which will contain this users access key and secret access key

    > **Note:** It's very important you download and save this CSV because once you've gone through this process we can't download them again.

10. To connect to Django, head to your project and install two new packages then freeze them into your requirements.txt;
  - $ pip3 install boto3
  - $ pip3 install django-storages
  - $ pip3 freeze > requirements.txt

11. In settings, add 'storages' to installed apps.

12. To connect Jdango to s3 add the below settings in settings.py which will tell it which bucket it should be communicating with;

        if 'USE_AWS' in os.environ:
            AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = 'lj-fscr'
            AWS_S3_REGION_NAME = 'eu-west-2'
            AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = os.environ.get('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID')
            AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = os.environ.get('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')
            AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN = f'{AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME}.s3.amazonaws.com'


13. Create a file called custom_storages.py and add the content below;

        from django.conf import settings
        from storages.backends.s3boto3 import S3Boto3Storage


        class StaticStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
            location = settings.STATICFILES_LOCATION


        class MediaStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
            location = settings.MEDIAFILES_LOCATION

    Then in settings.py add the below:

        STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.StaticStorage'
        STATICFILES_LOCATION = 'static'
        DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.MediaStorage'
        MEDIAFILES_LOCATION = 'media'

        STATIC_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{STATICFILES_LOCATION}/'
        MEDIA_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{MEDIAFILES_LOCATION}/'
</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Setting up Automatic Deployment to Heroku</summary>
<p>

1. From the Heroku deploy tab, select the Deployment method 'GitHub'.

    ![Deployment method](readme/media/deployment-method.jpg)

2. On the 'Connect to GitHub' section make sure your GitHub profile is displayed then add your repository name and click 'Search'.

    > **Note:** This is the name of your repo in GitHub. It is good practice to use an identical name for your Heroku app.

    ![Deploy GitHub](readme/media/deployment-git.jpg)

3. Your repo should now be displayed below, click 'Connect' to connect to this app.

4. Go to the Deploy tab on Heroku and under the Automatic deployment section, click 'Enable Automatic Deploys'. Then under Manual deploy click 'Deploy Branch'.

   ![Enable Automatic Deploys](readme/media/enable-deploys.jpg)

   - Heroku will now receive the code from GitHub and start building the app using the required packages.
   - Once built you will receive the message 'Your app was successfully deployed' and you can click 'View' to launch your new app.

        > **Note:** 
        In Manual deploy dropdown 'master' is selected'

</details>

`Sensitive data` for your project can either be stored in your environment settings or be added to an env.py file in your workspace.

<details>
<summary>More details on creating an env.py file</summary> 
<p>

1. Add a env.py file to store environment variables:

    `os.environ.setdefault("Key", "Value")`


| Key               | Value               |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID | To be added by user |
| AWS_SECRET_KEY_ID | To be added by user |
| DATABASE_URL      | To be added by user |
| EMAIL_HOST_PASS   | To be added by user |
| EMAIL_HOST_USER   | To be added by user |
| SECRET_KEY        | To be added by user |
| STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY | To be added by user |
| STRIPE_SECRET_KEY | To be added by user |
| STRIPE_WH_SECRET  | To be added by user |

 2. Add env.py to your .gitignore file to ensure this file is never pushed to GitHub.
    > **Note:** The env.py mustn't be tracked as any GitHub user can access your confidential data.
